WebClient:\
In Spring Boot, WebClient is a non-blocking, reactive HTTP client introduced in Spring WebFlux as part of the Spring Reactive framework. It is designed to perform HTTP requests in a non-blocking and asynchronous manner, making it ideal for building reactive applications that require high concurrency and scalability.


``` 
When we say WebClient is used to call external RESTful APIs, fetch data, and process the responses reactively, it means:

1. Calling External RESTful APIs:
Your Spring Boot application (backend server) uses WebClient to send HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to external APIs (e.g., third-party services or other microservices).
For example, your backend might call an external weather API to fetch weather data or a payment gateway API to process payments.

2. Fetching Data:
WebClient sends the request to the external API and retrieves the response (e.g., JSON, XML, or plain text).

3. Processing Responses Reactively:
The response is processed in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner using reactive programming constructs like Mono (for single responses) or Flux (for streams of data).
This means your application doesn’t wait (block) for the external API to respond. Instead, it continues performing other tasks and processes the response when it arrives.

```

``` 
Key Uses of WebClient in Spring Boot:

Non-Blocking HTTP Requests:
WebClient is designed to perform HTTP requests without blocking the calling thread. This is particularly useful in reactive applications where you want to handle multiple requests concurrently without waiting for each request to complete.

Integration with Reactive Programming:
WebClient integrates seamlessly with Project Reactor (e.g., Mono and Flux), allowing you to chain and compose asynchronous operations in a declarative way.

Support for RESTful APIs:
It is commonly used to call external RESTful APIs, fetch data, and process the responses reactively.

Streaming Data:
WebClient can handle streaming data (e.g., Server-Sent Events or large JSON payloads) efficiently by processing data chunks as they arrive.

Better Performance:
Since WebClient is non-blocking, it can handle a large number of concurrent requests with fewer threads compared to traditional blocking clients like RestTemplate.

Modern Alternative to RestTemplate:
WebClient is the recommended replacement for the older RestTemplate, which is blocking and less suitable for reactive applications.


```

Backend Responsibility:
* The backend (your Spring Boot server) is responsible for:
* Calling the external API using WebClient.
* Fetching and processing the response reactively.
* Sending a processed response back to the frontend.

* WebClient processes the external API’s response reactively, meaning it doesn’t block the thread while waiting for the response. This improves scalability and performance.
